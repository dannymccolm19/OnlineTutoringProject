# OnlineTutoringProject
This is an online tutoring website created by me and some students for a class project.
# How to Run
Inside the project directory run 'npm install' and then 'npm start' in terminal.
Note that ther database is not running, so you can just see the webpages.
You can go to http://localhost:3000/home to bypass the login/signup screens
# Info
This project was created using javascript react as well as css styling and an sql database.
I did most of my work on the webpages, found in the components folder.
